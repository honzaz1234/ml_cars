# Project Summary

The aim of this project is to create a model for predicting used car prices. In order to achieve this I have collected data set of more than 650 000 observations from website carvago.com. I divided the the task into 3 reports which can be found in folder reports. In the first one of them - data_exploration, the data at hand is explored. I look at data completness, distribution of individual variables found in the data set and also the relationship between target variable - price and potential predictors is explored. In the second report - data_cleaning, there can be  script found used to create a data set that can be used for model training with the description for how and why indiviudal changes to the original data set were made. Finally, in the report model_selection, I survey different models and their individual specifications in order to find the best suited model for the price prediction. The project also contains two additional files - functions in which the functions for working with data in first two reports (data_cleaning and data_exploration) are contained and file ml_class which contains python class used for collecting metrics from all the models and their specifications estimated in the last report (model_selection).
